## Description

_When the user picks a start point location, this app displays an [isoline](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line) shape around that location; the edges are the furthest that the user can walk within the amount of minutes they input. Points near the start location will also appear on the map so the user can see whether a bar is within the shape, and within the range they are willing to walk. Users can also click on each point to see the name and address of bars they would like to check out_
